GEGVIC is a workflow to analyse Gene Expression, Genetic Variations and Immune cell Composition of tumour samples using Next Generation Sequencing data. This is a common need in the majority of the laboratories in the world, however, many times the high variety of tools available to perform each individual task can confuse and difficult the process. 

It comes in two different flavours: 

## GEGVIC

An easy-to-use tool in a form of an R package that requires few input files, provides a good flexibility and produces appealing outputs when comparing a group of samples for (i) differential gene expression, (ii) genetic variations and (iii) immune cell composition.
